                    <br>
                    <h2>Preference for Traditional Art</h2>
                    <p>Participants expressed a preference for traditional visual art forms, 
                    for example: Mona Lisa. 
                    The emotional richness and perceived authenticity of traditional art were seen as more impactful on mental health compared to virtual art.

                    <h2>Navigation Challenges</h2>
                    <p>User engagement was hindered by navigation challenges and usability issues within virtual art environments. 
                    These challenges emerged as obstacles in creating positive outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Two lessons I learned from my UX research is the importance of actively listening to participants and encouraging them to express their thoughts verbally. 
                    Through this approach, I learned that participants often share deeper insights and emotions. 
                    This not only builds trust but also enables participants to provide more honest and valuable feedback. 
                    It became clear that promoting vocal expression during user interviews can uncover valuable insights. </p>
